# [Funkin Forever Engine](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
An open-source [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine
----------------------------------------------
Funkin' Forever, or Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. The engine is still unfinished, but it's getting there. Within the span of a week, if all goes well, it should be perfectly fine to use, as long as I don't forget to fix FNF songs themselves, aside from that, with the exception of custom controls, the engine is completely useable.

----------------------------------------------
This Engine is mostly a restructure but also in a lot of ways a rewrite of the base Funkin engine that you can find [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

----------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG UNMARKED HOTFIX
* Removes leftover tankman assets, the game will still load them if provided with the sprites but will no longer come with the week 7 songs or sprites, both out of respect for newgrounds and compliance of gamebanana modding rules (that I had no idea existed lmao)
* fixed some misc stuff, like the game refusing to compile, bugs with loading note stuffs (I'm working on an improved note map system, stay tuned, you'll be able to do some powerful shit with it and it'll be really easy to edit!)

CHANGELOG v0.2.1
* custom controls lmao
* fixed some misc bugs and glitches

  * 0.2.1.1 fixes a stupid oversight

CHANGELOG v0.2.0
* removed most week 7 stuffs because I respect newgrounds and they werent meant to be in for the release I just wanted to test
* options menu, main menu, title screen, story menu, freeplay menu
* custom color coding freeplay menu based on weeks! (or songs)
* week 7 icon formatting
* week 7 offset formatting (offset editor coming soon)
* no changes to the chart editor (don't use it yet its still very buggy and limited)
* some stuff got overhauled
* note timings and better ratings
* negative combos and epic pixel stuffs I think (missing the miss rating for pixel still)

* forked skater from the engine (madness comes next)
----------------------------------------------


Planned Features:
* Offset Editor based on .txt files
* Custom Controls
* Translations (if enough support is given)
* Adjustable Note Colors
* Misc Rhythm Game features
  * Offsets (maybe)
  * Note colors based on Rhythm
  * Modcharts
  * Other general features that will make this engine stand out from others
* Modularity (? idk it sounds cool and smart [not like me lmao])

Current Features:
* Unfinished song editor
* A much more organised PlayState
* comments that are kind of funny
* idk im struggling to come up with features
* seriously this is very work in progress please understand
* probably a better input system idk???
* even less features than last time lmao
* no seriously I have to add filler features like this
* to make it look somewhat longer
* because I actually removed and maintained some things

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!

----------------------------------------------
Thank you for checking out my engine! Got any questions? DM me at Shubs#0404 on Discord!
I'm **really** scared this will become obsolete when week 7 source comes out lmao so I'm gonna make it more classic rhythm game oriented in the future, as well as mod friendly, much like the base game, but much more hopefully!
